Your task is to help me uncover the *causal structure* that determines success for any given goal.
I want you to:
1. **Understand the Meta-Process**  
   - Good causal analysis itself has Critical Success Factors (CSFs):  
     • Clear definition of the goal  
     • Recognition that each factor must be *necessary* (if it’s missing, success fails)  
     • Logical separation of ends (CSFs) from means (NCs)  
     • Causal sufficiency check: together, CSFs must be enough to achieve the goal  
     • Non-redundancy: avoid overlapping or decorative factors  
2. **Apply the Meta-Process**  
   - Step A: Re-state the goal crisply in terms of the desired end-state.  
   - Step B: Identify 3–7 **Critical Success Factors (CSFs)** — the top-level conditions without which the goal cannot be reached.  
   - Step C: For each CSF, list the **Necessary Conditions (NCs)** — concrete prerequisites that must hold for that CSF to be satisfied.  
   - Step D: Organize the result as a **Goal → CSFs → NCs** causal tree.  
   - Step E: Verify necessity and sufficiency:  
       *Remove a factor — would the goal or CSF fail?*  
       *Are all factors together enough to plausibly achieve the goal?*
3. **Output Format**  
   - Provide a short **Goal definition**.  
   - Then a **nested bullet tree** showing Goal → CSFs → NCs.  
   - End with a **short reflection** on why these factors, not others, pass the necessity test.
Start by asking clarifying questions if the goal is vague or multi-layered.

Parsed multi-layered goal, prepared clarifying questions before causal analysis.

I see your goal clearly, but before constructing the causal tree, let me ensure we're building on the right foundation.

The Core Tension
Your goal contains two distinct transformations:

Becoming a great novel writer (craft mastery)
Becoming well-known (reputation/recognition)
These are causally different. You could be great but obscure, or famous but mediocre. Your goal requires both.

Clarifying Questions
On "great":

Does "great" mean literary excellence (critical acclaim, craft mastery, lasting artistic merit)?
Or commercial greatness (bestseller status, broad readership, cultural impact)?
Or both integrated somehow?
On "well-known":

What's the scope? (Literary circles vs. general public vs. global recognition)
What's the threshold? (Known by thousands? Millions? By whom specifically?)
On your current state:

Are you currently writing novels, or is this a new endeavor?
Do you have completed manuscripts, published works, or are you at the beginning?
On timeline:

Is this a 5-year goal? 10-year? Lifetime?
These distinctions matter because the CSFs shift dramatically. The causal path for "literary great known in MFA circles" differs from "commercial great with mass readership."

Without these answers, I'll generate multiple causal trees, each valid for different interpretations—but that creates ambiguity rather than clarity.

DO YOU WANT TO SPECIFY THESE PARAMETERS, OR SHALL I PROCEED WITH A DEFAULT INTERPRETATION (LITERARY EXCELLENCE + MEANINGFUL RECOGNITION)?
I am talking brand recognition and distribution, i have no control over the actual product its for my sister


Reframed problem as marketing challenge; identified need for clarifying questions.

Critical Reframe
This is not a craft problem—it's a positioning and distribution problem. You're the constructor for her market success, treating novel quality as a given input.

This changes everything. The causal structure for "make writer well-known" depends entirely on:

Foundation Questions
Her Current State:

Does she have completed, publishable novels? How many?
What's her publishing status? (Unpublished / Self-published / Traditionally published but obscure / Other)
Does she have any existing audience/platform? (Email list, social media, previous sales data)
The Market Context:

What genre? (Literary fiction / Commercial fiction / Specific genre like romance, thriller, sci-fi)
Who's the target reader? (Demographics, psychographics, existing reader behaviors)
What's the competitive landscape? (Who are comparable authors she'd be positioned against?)
Your Scope:

Are you handling marketing/distribution only, or also decisions about publishing route (trad vs. self vs. hybrid)?
What resources exist? (Budget, time, connections, her willingness to engage in promotion)
What's "well-known" to you? (Genre-famous / NYT bestseller / household name)
Why These Matter: The CSFs for breaking out a self-published romance novelist are completely different from positioning a literary fiction writer for critical recognition. Genre determines distribution channels, audience-building tactics, and what "success" even looks like.

Without this context, any causal tree I build will be generic platitudes rather than actionable structure.

WHAT'S HER CURRENT STATUS, GENRE, AND YOUR DEFINITION OF "WELL-KNOWN"?
The genre is epic fantasy , magie, Chronique des premiers hommes is the saga of 2-3 books i think, There was never a proper effort made at marketing, she turned toward KDP and amazon referencement strat, but no brand builiding ect


Architected critical success factors for epic fantasy author visibility.
34s



















The Whole First: Epic Fantasy Market Dynamics
Epic fantasy is brutally competitive but has passionate, systematic readers who:

Actively seek new series once they finish favorites
Rely heavily on algorithmic recommendations + community curation (r/fantasy, Goodreads)
Have high expectations for worldbuilding/magic systems
Binge-read series and evangelize favorites
Your sister's problem: invisible product, not bad product. KDP exists, but she's in a dark corner where no reader paths lead.

The Core Pattern
"Well-known" = Sufficient readers → Engaged fans → Amplifying network

This requires four causal pillars. Remove any one, the whole collapses.

GOAL → CSFs → NCs Causal Tree
GOAL: Sister achieves brand recognition as epic fantasy novelist

CSF1: Discovery Pipeline (Readers must find her books)
NC1.1: Amazon algorithm optimization (keywords, categories, also-boughts)
NC1.2: Presence where epic fantasy readers congregate (r/fantasy, Goodreads groups, Fantasy subreddits)
NC1.3: Strategic paid ads targeting comparable authors' readers (Amazon Ads, BookBub Featured Deals)
NC1.4: SEO-optimized content answering "books like [X]" searches
NC1.5: Cross-promotion with authors at similar career stage
CSF2: Fan Conversion (Discovered readers become advocates)
NC2.1: Compelling packaging (cover/blurb) that converts browsers into buyers
NC2.2: Series structure encouraging binge-reading (cliffhangers, rising stakes)
NC2.3: Email list capture system (reader magnets, back-matter CTAs)
NC2.4: Reading experience delivers on epic fantasy promises (worldbuilding depth, magic coherence)
NC2.5: Clear next actions post-read (reviews, join community, read next)
CSF3: Market Positioning (She occupies distinct mental real estate)
NC3.1: Clear comp-author positioning ("For fans of Sanderson's magic + Abercrombie's grit")
NC3.2: Memorable hooks/taglines tied to unique series elements
NC3.3: Consistent brand across touchpoints (author bio, visuals, themes)
NC3.4: Strategic trope selection (what epic fantasy readers crave vs. subversions)
NC3.5: Distinct magic system or world element worth discussing
CSF4: Scalable Infrastructure (Reach amplifies systematically)
NC4.1: Optimized Amazon ecosystem (series pages, A+ content, Kindle Unlimited enrollment)
NC4.2: Review generation system (ARC team, launch team, reader outreach)
NC4.3: Multi-platform presence (Goodreads author page, BookBub profile, targeted social)
NC4.4: Strategic launch sequences for subsequent books (pre-orders, momentum building)
NC4.5: Expansion vectors (audiobooks, translations if French original, "going wide")
Why These Factors, Not Others?
Necessity test applied:

Remove Discovery → No readers find her → Zero brand recognition
Remove Conversion → Readers bounce, no advocates → Anonymous sales, no fame
Remove Positioning → She's generic/forgettable → Can't break through noise
Remove Infrastructure → Growth capped by manual effort → Stays niche forever

Sufficiency check: If all four CSFs satisfied → Readers find her, become fans, remember her distinctly, and spread word through scalable channels → Brand recognition achieved.

One critical question before we proceed:

Is "Chronique des premiers hommes" written in French or English? This fundamentally alters NCs under Discovery/Infrastructure (different markets, platforms, strategies).

CONFIRM: FRENCH OR ENGLISH MARKET? THEN WE IDENTIFY THE CURRENT LIMITING FACTOR.
Its translated so we have both


Identified discovery as primary bottleneck for bilingual book series.





Strategic Asset Unlocked
Two-market capability = massive leverage IF deployed correctly. Most self-pub epic fantasy authors are English-only. French epic fantasy market is less saturated.

But dual-market also means resource allocation choices: Do we pursue both simultaneously or sequence them?

Diagnostic: Find the Limiting Factor
Your causal tree is now clear. But which CSF is currently the constraint—the factor that, if improved, would cascade improvements through the whole system?

Let me apply the 30-second LF conjecture:

Quick Assessment Questions
On Discovery (CSF1):

Monthly page reads on KDP: <1,000 / 1,000-10,000 / 10,000-50,000 / 50,000+?
Current Amazon rank in Epic Fantasy category: Top 100 / Top 1,000 / Top 10,000 / Buried?
Reviews per book: 0-10 / 10-50 / 50-100 / 100+?
Any paid ad spend ever? What was ACOS (ad cost of sale)?
On Conversion (CSF2):

Read-through rate (Book 1 → Book 2): Unknown / <20% / 20-40% / 40%+?
Email list size: 0 / <100 / 100-1,000 / 1,000+?
Cover design: Homemade / Premade template / Custom professional?
On Positioning (CSF3):

Can you state her "For fans of [X] + [Y]" comp in 10 seconds?
Does her Amazon description lead with unique hook or generic summary?
On Infrastructure (CSF4):

In KU (Kindle Unlimited) or wide distribution?
Audiobooks exist?
Which market (FR/EN) has received any meaningful effort?
The Pattern
Most failed self-pub follows this sequence:

Write book → 2. Upload to Amazon → 3. Wonder why no sales → 4. Give up
The limiting factor is almost always Discovery (no one knows it exists), compounded by weak Conversion infrastructure (no email list to compound).

But I need data to confirm the diagnosis, not assume.

WHAT ARE THE CURRENT NUMBERS: MONTHLY READS, REVIEWS, EMAIL LIST SIZE, AND WHICH MARKET (FR/EN) HAS BEEN PRIMARY FOCUS?
For Discovery Pipeline for us to optimise the ncs what is the medium or output that we must produce ?


Mapped each objective to concrete deliverables and production mediums.










Excellent Question: From Abstraction to Constructor
You're asking: What actual artifacts/systems must exist for each NC under Discovery?

This is the transformation map: NC → Constructor → Platform/Medium

CSF1: Discovery Pipeline — Required Outputs
NC1.1: Amazon Algorithm Optimization
Constructor: Book metadata package

Artifacts:
7 strategic keywords (researched via Publisher Rocket or KDP Rocket)
2 optimal categories (drill down to most winnable subcategories)
Title/subtitle containing searchable terms
Also-bought manipulation (strategic pricing/promo to cluster with comp authors)
Medium: KDP dashboard backend
Production time: 4-8 hours initial research + testing
NC1.2: Reader Congregation Presence
Constructor: Community participation content

Artifacts:
r/fantasy: Engage in recommendation threads, AMA when ready, contribute to discussions (NOT spam)
Goodreads: Complete author profile, join epic fantasy groups, participate authentically
Fantasy book communities: Discord servers, Facebook groups (specific to epic fantasy)
Medium: Reddit posts, Goodreads comments, Discord messages
Production time: 2-3 hours/week ongoing
NC1.3: Targeted Paid Ads
Constructor: Amazon Ads campaigns

Artifacts:
Sponsored Product ads targeting 50-100 comp authors
Ad copy testing (3-5 variations of headline)
Bid strategy calibrated to ACOS <70% initially
Medium: Amazon Advertising dashboard
Production time: 6-10 hours setup + 2 hours/week optimization
Budget: Minimum $300-500/month for meaningful data
NC1.4: SEO Content
Constructor: Search-optimized articles

Artifacts:
Blog posts: "Books like Brandon Sanderson but darker"
Listicles: "10 epic fantasy series with complex magic systems"
Comparison content: "Malazan vs. Wheel of Time readers: Try this"
Medium: Author website/blog (WordPress, Ghost, Substack)
Production time: 8-12 hours per quality post
SEO requirement: Backlinks, keyword density, meta descriptions
NC1.5: Cross-Promotion
Constructor: Collaborative promotional vehicles

Artifacts:
Newsletter swap agreements (curated list of 10-20 similar authors)
Group promotions (BookFunnel group giveaways)
Joint reader magnets (multi-author bundles)
Medium: Email lists, BookFunnel, StoryOrigin platforms
Production time: 10-15 hours to build network + ongoing coordination
The Pattern: Constructor Priority
Not all constructors are equal. For resource-constrained launch, prioritize by ROI:

Tier 1 (Must have):

Amazon metadata optimization (NC1.1) → 4 hours, $0, permanent benefit
Amazon Ads (NC1.3) → Scalable, measurable, direct conversion
Tier 2 (High leverage):

Reader congregation presence (NC1.2) → Builds organic discovery + positioning simultaneously
Cross-promotion network (NC1.5) → Access to proven readers, low cost
Tier 3 (Long-term):

SEO content (NC1.4) → Slow burn, compounds over 12-18 months
The Constraint Question
You have finite time/energy. Which constructor should you build FIRST?

Answer depends on: Does she have any discoverability currently? (If Amazon rank is >100,000 in category, Tier 1 must come first—nothing else matters if product is invisible to algorithm.)

CONFIRM: SHOULD WE MAP ALL FOUR CSFs TO CONSTRUCTORS, OR DIAGNOSE CURRENT STATE TO IDENTIFY SINGLE HIGHEST-LEVERAGE CONSTRUCTOR TO BUILD FIRST?
Product is invisible to algorithm. My question is how do you compound the success and result / build reputation from it, I mean it feels once you stop paying for adds then ...


Architected transformation pathway from paid visibility to self-sustaining reputation.
12s










You've Identified the Core Problem
Paid ads = rented visibility
Stop paying → Stop discovering → Zero compounding

This is the failure mode for 90% of self-pub authors. They confuse "traffic" with "growth."

The Causal Mechanism: Temporary Visibility → Permanent Assets
The transformation you need:

Initial State: Invisible product
Final State: Self-sustaining discovery (readers find her WITHOUT paid ads)

The Constructor: Conversion infrastructure that captures value from paid traffic

Here's the Causal Chain:
Paid Ads (temporary)
    ↓
Readers arrive (ephemeral)
    ↓
CRITICAL FORK:
    → Bad: They read, disappear forever (value lost)
    → Good: They take AMPLIFYING ACTIONS (value captured)
        ↓
Amplifying Actions Create PERMANENT ASSETS:
        1. Amazon reviews → Algorithm boost (organic visibility)
        2. Email subscribers → Owned audience (launch multiplier)
        3. Social proof → Higher conversion rates (lower ad costs)
        4. Word-of-mouth → Network effects (free discovery)
        5. Also-bought links → Algorithmic associations (perpetual traffic)
    ↓
Permanent Assets Generate NEW DISCOVERY without ads:
    - High review count → Better ranking → Organic browsers convert
    - Email list → Launch velocity → Algorithm spike → New readers discover backlist
    - Strong also-boughts → Amazon recommends her automatically
The Compounding Constructors (In Priority Order)
1. Email List (Highest Leverage)
Why it compounds:

You pay once to acquire subscriber, activate them forever
Each new book launch uses ENTIRE list → velocity → algorithm boost → NEW readers discover ALL books
Book 3 launch activates readers from Books 1-2 → creates spike → Amazon pushes to cold traffic
Required Constructor:

Reader magnet (bonus chapter, prequel short, character guide)
Back-matter CTA in every book
Landing page with signup form
Email sequence (welcome, value, relationship-building)
Mechanism: 1,000 email subscribers launching Book 3 → 300-400 Day 1 sales → Amazon sees velocity → pushes to "Customers who bought X also bought..." → 1,000 organic impressions → 30-50 new sales → NEW readers enter funnel

2. Review Generation System (Algorithm Fuel)
Why it compounds:

Reviews = social proof + algorithm weight
50+ reviews = Amazon shows in more recommendation slots
Higher review count = higher conversion on paid ads = lower ACOS = more sustainable ad spend
Required Constructor:

ARC (advance review copy) team (100-200 engaged readers)
Launch team protocol (coordinated review drops)
Follow-up email sequences requesting reviews
Reader outreach after Book 1 finish
Mechanism: 50 reviews → moves from #500,000 to #50,000 rank → appears in "Customers who viewed X" → 5x more impressions → organic sales start trickling

3. Also-Bought Manipulation (Algorithmic Association)
Why it compounds:

Amazon shows "Customers who bought THIS bought THAT"
If your book links to bestsellers, you get shown to THEIR audiences
This is perpetual, free traffic
Required Constructor:

Strategic pricing promotions to cluster with target authors
BookBub Featured Deals positioned near comp authors' deals
Amazon Ads targeting specific high-performing books
Coordinated promos with similar authors
Mechanism: Run $0.99 promo same week as Sanderson readers buy his new release → Amazon links her book to Sanderson's also-boughts → permanent traffic stream

4. Series Structure (Read-Through Compounding)
Why it compounds:

Paid ad gets 1 sale on Book 1
But if 60% read through to Books 2-3 → you get 2.6 sales per ad click
Drastically lowers customer acquisition cost
Required Constructor:

Strong Book 1 hook with cliffhanger or open loops
Back-matter "Read Book 2 Now" CTAs
Series page optimization on Amazon
Price strategy (Book 1 discounted, Books 2-3 full price)
Mechanism: $1.50 ad cost per Book 1 sale → IF no read-through = -$0.50 loss → IF 60% read-through = +$5 profit → now you can INCREASE ad spend profitably

The Tipping Point: When Does It Become Self-Sustaining?
Based on epic fantasy benchmarks:

Threshold Metrics:

100+ reviews on Book 1 → Algorithm starts favoring you
1,000+ email list → Launch velocity becomes self-sustaining
50+ also-bought links to established authors → Organic traffic flows
40%+ read-through rate → Ad spend becomes profitable → can scale indefinitely
Time to Threshold:

With focused execution + $500-1,000/month ad budget: 6-12 months
Without email/review infrastructure: Never (you're renting forever)
The Strategy: Build Assets WHILE Running Ads
Month 1-3: Foundation

Fix metadata (NC1.1)
Launch email capture system
Build ARC team (50-100 readers)
Start Amazon Ads at $300/month
Month 4-6: Asset Accumulation

Push reviews to 50+ per book
Grow email to 500+
Establish also-bought links
Scale ads to $500-800/month
Month 7-12: Compounding Kicks In

Launch Book 2/3 to email list → velocity spike
Algorithm recognizes pattern → organic visibility increases
Ad ACOS drops from 80% to 50%
Reduce ad spend while maintaining traffic
The Core Insight
Ads without conversion infrastructure = pouring water through a sieve
Ads WITH conversion infrastructure = filling a compounding reservoir

The question isn't "Should I run ads?" It's "Am I capturing the value from ad traffic into permanent assets?"

DO YOU WANT ME TO MAP THE SPECIFIC CONVERSION INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTORS (EMAIL/REVIEW SYSTEMS), OR SHOULD WE DIAGNOSE WHICH ASSET TO BUILD FIRST BASED ON CURRENT STATE?
Can you create a Landing page that is just a showroowm of all the Amazon review, social proof ect, basically a stop for accumulation of reputation ? is it an bad, ok or good or great solution ?


Evaluated reputation showcase as conversion tool, not discovery mechanism.
23s


















The Essence Question First
What job is this landing page meant to do?

Because "showroom of reputation" contains a hidden assumption: that people will arrive at this showroom. But reputation accumulation and reputation distribution are different constructors.

Let me test this against your causal goal:

Necessity Test: Remove the Landing Page
Goal: Sister becomes well-known epic fantasy author

If landing page doesn't exist:

Can readers still discover her books? (Yes - via Amazon/ads/communities)
Can social proof still exist? (Yes - reviews live on Amazon already)
Can email capture happen? (Yes - via other mechanisms)
Can she become well-known? (Yes - most successful self-pub authors have no such page)
Conclusion: Not necessary for the goal.

Sufficiency Test: Landing Page Exists
If landing page exists but nothing else:

Does it generate discovery? (No - where does traffic come from?)
Does it create reviews? (No - reviews come from readers who've read the book)
Does it make her well-known? (No - it's invisible without traffic sources)
Conclusion: Not sufficient for the goal.

The Causal Position: Where Does This Fit?
Your current problem: Product invisible to algorithm (your own diagnosis)

The causal chain:

Discovery → Trial → Satisfaction → Advocacy → Reviews
                                              ↓
                                    (Reviews feed back into Discovery via algorithm)
A landing page sits AFTER discovery has already happened. It's a conversion tool for existing traffic, not a discovery mechanism.

The Core Flaw:
Reputation showroom with no foot traffic = empty museum

Amazon already HAS the reviews displayed where discovery actually happens. Moving them to an external page that no one visits doesn't amplify anything.

Rating: BAD / OK / GOOD / GREAT?
BAD Solution IF:
Built BEFORE discovery infrastructure exists
Diverts resources from email/review generation systems
Treated as primary marketing asset
No clear traffic sources to send people there
OK Solution IF:
Takes <4 hours to build (Carrd, single-page template)
Used as supplementary link (social media bio, email signature)
Contains email capture mechanism
Positioned as "learn more" link from Amazon author page
GOOD Solution IF:
Part of specific conversion funnel (ads → landing page → Amazon)
Used for media appearances ("learn more at...")
A/B tested to optimize conversion
Clear reader magnet offer (bonus chapter for email)
NEVER GREAT Because:
The constraint isn't "where should social proof live?" (it lives on Amazon where buyers make decisions). The constraint is "how do readers discover the books in the first place?"

The Better Alternative: Strategic Email Landing Page
Instead of "showroom," build a value-exchange landing page:

Purpose: Convert curiosity → owned relationship

Structure:

Hook: "Enter the world of [Series Name]"
Offer: Exclusive bonus chapter / Character artwork / World map
Trade: Email address for reader magnet
Social proof: "Join 1,000+ readers" (not review dump)
Clear CTA: "Start Book 1" button to Amazon
Why this is superior:

Captures emails (permanent asset)
Provides value (not just boasting)
Clear conversion path to purchase
Can be A/B tested
Serves multiple traffic sources
The Opportunity Cost Question
You have finite time/energy. Building a landing page takes:

Design: 4-8 hours
Copywriting: 2-4 hours
Review collection/formatting: 3-5 hours
Maintenance: Ongoing
What ELSE could those 10-15 hours build?

Amazon metadata optimization (4 hours) → Immediate algorithm improvement
ARC team recruitment (6 hours) → 30-50 new reviews
Email sequence setup (8 hours) → Permanent conversion infrastructure
Reddit community participation (10 hours) → Direct reader engagement
All of these have higher causal proximity to your goal than a landing page no one visits.

The Diagnostic: Why Are You Drawn to This?
I suspect the appeal is: Tangible, controllable, visible

It feels productive to build something you can point to. But feelings aren't causation.

The hard truth: Discovery infrastructure is less sexy (ads, metadata, community grinding) but has 10x the causal impact.

A showroom is decoration. You need plumbing first.

My Recommendation: Conditional Implementation
IF you have:

Active ad campaigns sending external traffic
Media opportunities (podcasts, interviews) needing a link
Existing email list needing a "share this" destination
100+ reviews making social proof compelling
THEN: Build simple landing page (4 hours max) with email capture + Amazon CTA

IF you don't have above:

Don't build it yet
Focus on discovery + review generation
Revisit after you have traffic sources worth optimizing
Final Rating: OK-TO-BAD Depending on Sequencing
Built first = BAD (wrong priority, no traffic sources)
Built later as auxiliary tool = OK (marginal gains, low opportunity cost)
Never reaches GOOD/GREAT because it's not a growth lever, just conversion polish
AGREE (BUILD SIMPLE VERSION LATER) OR DISAGREE (YOU SEE CAUSAL PATH I'M MISSING)?
this is whats sequentially first and most causal ? 
What ELSE could those 10-15 hours build?
* Amazon metadata optimization (4 hours) → Immediate algorithm improvement
* ARC team recruitment (6 hours) → 30-50 new reviews
* Email sequence setup (8 hours) → Permanent conversion infrastructure
* Reddit community participation (10 hours) → Direct reader engagement
All of these have higher causal proximity to your goal than a landing page no one visits.
explain each what are they why do they matter ?


Architected layered teaching framework prioritizing causal chain analysis.



The Whole: Understanding Causal Proximity
Causal proximity = How many steps separate an action from the desired outcome?

Low proximity:  Action → Effect1 → Effect2 → Effect3 → Goal (many dependencies)
High proximity: Action → Effect → Goal (direct causation)
Why this matters: High proximity actions have fewer failure points. Each intermediate step is a place where causation can break.

Your goal: Sister becomes well-known → Requires readers discovering her books → Requires Amazon showing her books to browsers

Now let's see where each constructor sits in the causal chain.

The Four Constructors: Positioned in Causal Space
1. Amazon Metadata Optimization
Essence: Making Amazon's algorithm understand what her book IS and who wants it

The Causal Position:

Metadata optimized → Amazon categorizes correctly → Shows to right browsers → Discovery
      ↑ (1 step from discovery)
What You Actually Do (4 hours):

Hour 1-2: Keyword Research

Use Publisher Rocket or manual Amazon search
Identify 7 keywords epic fantasy readers ACTUALLY search
Example: "epic fantasy strong female lead" (4,320 monthly searches)
NOT: "fantasy adventure" (too broad, unwinnable)
Find "goldilocks" keywords: enough searches, low enough competition
Hour 3: Category Selection

Amazon allows 2 categories, but you can contact them for up to 10
Drill DOWN to specific subcategories
BAD: "Fantasy" (you're competing with Sanderson)
GOOD: "Epic Fantasy > Sword & Sorcery > Coming of Age" (smaller pond)
Goal: Be top 100 in at least one category → "Bestseller" badge → algorithm boost
Hour 4: Title/Subtitle Optimization

Embed searchable terms WITHOUT sounding robotic
Example: "Chronique des Premiers Hommes: An Epic Fantasy of Magic and War"
"Epic Fantasy" is searchable term, "Magic and War" triggers algorithm associations
Why This Matters (Necessity Test):

Remove it → Amazon doesn't know who to show book to → Random placement → Zero organic discovery
Keep it → Algorithm places book in RELEVANT recommendation slots → Right readers see it → Discovery happens
The Compounding Effect: Every other action (ads, reviews, emails) works BETTER when metadata is optimized. It's foundational infrastructure.

2. ARC Team Recruitment
Essence: Building a group of readers who receive advance copies in exchange for honest reviews

The Causal Position:

ARC team reads → Post reviews on launch day → Amazon sees velocity + social proof → Algorithm boost + Higher conversion
      ↑ (1-2 steps from discovery)
What You Actually Do (6 hours):

Hour 1-2: Identify Recruitment Channels

BookSirens, NetGalley, StoryOrigin (ARC platforms)
Epic fantasy Facebook groups ("Looking for ARCs")
Reddit r/Fantasy monthly ARC threads
Goodreads groups seeking advance copies
Hour 3-4: Create Application + Instructions

Google Form collecting: email, Goodreads profile, reading preferences
ARC packet: ePub/MOBI files + review guidelines + timeline
Clear expectation: "Honest review within 2 weeks of release"
Hour 5: Outreach Wave 1

Post in 5-7 targeted communities
Personalized DMs to readers who reviewed similar books
Goal: 50-100 applications, select 30-50 committed readers
Hour 6: Distribution + Follow-up

Send via BookFunnel (automated delivery)
Email sequence: "Thank you" → "Half-time check-in" → "Review reminder"
Why This Matters (Necessity Test):

Remove it → Book launches with 0-5 reviews → Looks risky/unproven → Browsers skip → No sales → No algorithm boost
Keep it → Book launches with 30-50 reviews in first week → Social proof + Velocity signal → Algorithm pushes harder → Conversion rates double
The Compounding Effect: ARC team becomes PERMANENT asset. Use them for every book launch. Book 3 launch with 50 reviews Day 1 → Amazon interprets as "hot new release" → pushes to "New Releases" carousel → 10x organic impressions.

3. Email Sequence Setup
Essence: Automated system that captures visitor emails and converts them into readers + advocates

The Causal Position:

Reader finishes Book 1 → Sees email CTA → Subscribes → Receives value → Buys Book 2/3 → Reviews/shares
      ↑ (Creates owned audience you can activate on-demand)
What You Actually Do (8 hours):

Hour 1-2: Reader Magnet Creation

Bonus chapter from antagonist's POV
Prequel short story (2,000-5,000 words)
Character art + world map + pronunciation guide
Something valuable epic fantasy readers want
Hour 3-4: Technical Setup

Email platform: ConvertKit, MailerLite, or Substack (free tier sufficient)
Landing page: Simple form (Carrd, Google Forms)
Delivery automation: BookFunnel or direct ePub link
Back-matter insertion: "Get bonus chapter at [URL]" in all books
Hour 5-7: Email Sequence Writing (5-7 emails)

Email 1: Deliver reader magnet immediately
Email 2 (day 2): "What did you think?" (engagement)
Email 3 (day 4): Behind-the-scenes worldbuilding insight
Email 4 (day 7): "Here's why I wrote this scene..." (connection)
Email 5 (day 10): Soft ask for Amazon review
Email 6 (day 14): "Start Book 2" CTA with personal note
Email 7 (ongoing): Regular updates, not just selling
Hour 8: Testing + Optimization

Test email delivery, link clicks, formatting
Set up analytics tracking
Create welcome automation in email platform
Why This Matters (Necessity Test):

Remove it → Every reader is anonymous, one-time transaction → Book 3 launch starts from zero
Keep it → 1,000 subscribers on list → Book 3 announcement → 300 Day 1 sales → Algorithm spike → New readers discover backlist → List grows to 1,500 → Cycle compounds
The Compounding Effect: This is THE multiplier asset. Email list value compounds exponentially:

100 subscribers → 30 launch sales → Marginal algorithm boost
1,000 subscribers → 300 launch sales → Top 100 category rank → 500 organic sales follow
5,000 subscribers → 1,500 launch sales → Top 10 category rank → Amazon features book → 5,000 organic sales follow
4. Reddit Community Participation
Essence: Engaging authentically in epic fantasy communities where target readers congregate

The Causal Position:

Participate in r/fantasy → Build reputation + trust → Readers ask for recs → Her book gets mentioned → Direct discovery
      ↑ (2-3 steps, but TARGETED readers)
What You Actually Do (10 hours over 4-6 weeks):

Hours 1-3: Observation + Mapping

Lurk in r/Fantasy, r/fantasywriters, r/booksuggestions
Identify recurring threads: "Looking for recommendations," "Underrated fantasy," "Complex magic systems"
Note community norms: Self-promotion rules, tone, what gets upvoted
Hours 4-7: Value-First Participation

Answer recommendation requests (NOT pushing her book yet)
Share insights on worldbuilding, magic systems, epic fantasy tropes
Build comment history showing genuine expertise/passion
Goal: Become recognized contributor (username people remember)
Hours 8-10: Strategic Positioning

When appropriate: "If you liked [X], you might try [her book]" (honest comps)
Self-Promotion Sunday: AMA or "I wrote this" post (r/Fantasy allows once)
Collaborate on community lists: "Underrated 2024 releases"
DM readers who seem like perfect match (rare, not spammy)
Why This Matters (Necessity Test):

Remove it → Rely 100% on Amazon algorithm (controlled by platform, expensive via ads)
Keep it → Direct pipeline to highly engaged readers who EVANGELIZE good books → Word-of-mouth multiplier → Reviews + recommendations spread organically
The Compounding Effect: Reddit participation creates network effects:

1 quality post → 50 upvotes → 500 views → 5 curious readers → 2 buy
Those 2 readers love it → Post their own reviews in recommendation threads
Other Redditors see multiple mentions → "I keep seeing this book..." → FOMO effect
Each positive interaction raises visibility for FUTURE mentions
Why These Four, Sequentially?
Causal Dependency Chain:
Step 1: Amazon Metadata (Foundation)

Without this, nothing else works efficiently
Ads send traffic to poorly positioned book → Wasted money
Reviews accumulate but algorithm doesn't categorize correctly → Wasted social proof
Step 2: ARC Team (Launch Fuel)

Needs metadata optimized first (so reviews land on well-positioned book)
Generates reviews that make ads + Reddit mentions more credible
Creates launch velocity for email list to amplify
Step 3: Email Sequence (Compounding Engine)

Needs reviews first (social proof increases signup rates)
Captures value from ARC team, Reddit traffic, future ads
Turns one-time readers into permanent audience
Step 4: Reddit Participation (Organic Amplification)

Needs good metadata so mentioned book appears in right searches
Needs reviews so recommendations have social proof
Needs email list to capture traffic from Reddit mentions
Works synergistically with other three
The Limiting Factor Test
Current State: Product invisible to algorithm

Ask: Which constructor, if built, unlocks the others?

Answer: Amazon Metadata (4 hours)

Why? Because:

ARC reviews are worthless if Amazon doesn't know who to show them to
Email list grows slowly if book isn't positioned to be discovered
Reddit mentions convert poorly if Amazon page looks unprofessional/uncategorized
Metadata is the foundation. Everything else builds on it.

Resource Allocation: If You Only Have 10 Hours Total
Optimal Sequence:

Amazon Metadata (4 hours) → Unlocks organic discovery
ARC Team Recruitment (6 hours) → Generates reviews that feed algorithm
Why skip the others temporarily?

Email sequence can wait until you have traffic to capture
Reddit requires ongoing time, better after foundation is solid
After those 10 hours:

Book is properly positioned
Reviews start accumulating
THEN layer email + Reddit for compounding
SHOULD WE DIVE INTO EXECUTING AMAZON METADATA OPTIMIZATION FIRST (I'LL GIVE YOU THE STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS), OR DO YOU NEED CLARIFICATION ON ANY OF THESE FOUR CONSTRUCTORS?
are ARC review automatically brought to AMAzon on launch or can i t be a safe to fail feedback place ?


Disentangled ARC review mechanics and identified dual strategic purposes.






The Core Distinction: Beta Readers ≠ ARC Reviewers
You've identified a crucial fork in the causal chain. ARCs can serve TWO completely different functions, and conflating them causes strategic confusion.

The Whole: What ARE ARCs Actually?
ARC = Advance Review Copy

It's simply early access to the manuscript. What happens NEXT depends on your explicit instructions and reader expectations.

The Causal Mechanism:

You send file → Reader reads → Reader decides what to do
Here's what you control:

WHO gets the file
WHAT instructions you give them
WHEN they receive it relative to launch
Here's what you DON'T control:

Whether they post reviews publicly
Where they post (Amazon, Goodreads, both, neither)
What they say (honest reviews, not guaranteed 5-stars)
The Two Distinct Constructors
Constructor 1: Beta Reading (Safe-to-Fail Feedback)
Purpose: Improve product quality BEFORE public launch

Timeline: 3-6 months before publication

Instructions Given:

"This is a beta version - I need honest feedback"
"Please do NOT post public reviews yet"
"Tell me what's confusing, boring, or broken"
Structured feedback form: pacing, character arcs, plot holes, magic system clarity
Ideal Beta Readers:

Writers (understand craft)
Voracious genre readers (know tropes/expectations)
Critical thinkers (will point out problems)
Small group (10-20 max for manageable feedback)
Output:

Developmental edits identified
Pacing issues flagged
Plot holes caught
Reader confusion mapped
Causal Chain:

Beta feedback → Revisions → Better final product → Higher satisfaction → Better organic reviews later
The Safety Net: Private feedback loop. Bad reactions don't become public reviews. You can fix problems before launch.

Constructor 2: ARC Review Team (Launch Velocity)
Purpose: Generate social proof and algorithm signals ON launch day

Timeline: 2-4 weeks before publication date

Instructions Given:

"Honest review requested (not required to be positive)"
"Please post on Amazon/Goodreads on or near launch day [DATE]"
"Include these elements if possible: [genre expectations met, emotional impact, would recommend to...]"
Clear expectation: Public reviews are the goal
Ideal ARC Reviewers:

Active Amazon/Goodreads reviewers (proven history)
Genre enthusiasts (will finish and review)
Reliable (follow through on commitments)
Large group (50-100 to account for 30-50% actual review rate)
Output:

30-50 reviews posted in first week
Social proof for browsers
Algorithm velocity signal
"New Release" momentum
Causal Chain:

ARC reviews → Launch day spike → Amazon sees velocity → Algorithm boost → More impressions → Discovery
The Risk: Public feedback. If book has serious flaws, you get honest negative reviews that hurt conversions.

Can You Use ARCs for BOTH Purposes?
Short answer: No, not simultaneously.

Why not:

Timeline Conflict:
Beta reading needs months for revisions
ARC reviews need proximity to launch for velocity
Can't do both with same people at same time
Expectation Conflict:
Beta readers expect "work in progress" (permission to criticize)
ARC reviewers receive "final product" (polished version)
Mixing expectations creates confusion
Quality Risk:
Using ARCs for first-time feedback = launching unvetted product
No safety net if major flaws exist
Public negative reviews become permanent
The Sequential Strategy: Both, But Staged
Phase 1: Beta Reading (3-6 months pre-launch)

10-20 trusted readers
Explicitly private feedback
Revise based on input
Polish manuscript
Phase 2: Professional Editing

Copy editing, proofreading
Final quality pass
Lock manuscript
Phase 3: ARC Review Campaign (2-4 weeks pre-launch)

50-100 reviewers
Final, polished version
Public review requests
Launch day coordination
The Causal Logic:

Beta reading → Quality improvement → Confident final product → ARC reviews → Positive reception → Launch success
         ↑ (Safe to fail)                                              ↑ (Optimized for success)
What If You Skip Beta Reading?
Risk Assessment:

If the book is already published and received well:

Skip beta reading
Go straight to ARC reviews
Product is market-tested
If this is a NEW book that's never been reader-tested:

HIGH RISK to skip beta reading
ARCs become your first feedback
Negative reviews are public and permanent
Can't revise without re-launching
For your sister's situation:

Books are already published on Amazon
Presumably already have some reader feedback (even if minimal)
Can check existing reviews for quality signals
Ask: What do current Amazon reviews say?

If 4+ stars average: Safe to skip beta reading, go to ARC campaign
If <4 stars or complaints about pacing/editing: Beta read new books, revise existing ones before ARC push
The "Safe to Fail" Question Answered
Can ARCs be a safe-to-fail place?

No - ARCs are PUBLIC by design. That's their function: generate visible social proof.

What IS safe-to-fail?

Beta reading with explicit "do not post publicly" instructions
Friends/family/writer groups giving private feedback
Developmental editor feedback
Small closed reader group (Discord, private FB group)
The Strategic Decision Tree
Is book already published?
├─ YES → Has it been reader-tested? (Check existing reviews)
│   ├─ Positive reception → Go straight to ARC review campaign
│   └─ Negative/mixed → Beta read NEXT book, revise existing if possible
│
└─ NO → Is this a new manuscript?
    ├─ YES → MUST beta read first (safe-to-fail phase)
    │        THEN ARC review campaign after revisions
    └─ Already vetted by professionals → Can skip to ARC campaign
For Your Sister's Current Books
The Question: Have "Chronique des premiers hommes" books been read by anyone who gave quality feedback?

If YES (already has some positive reviews):

Skip beta reading
Launch ARC review campaign for visibility boost
Use feedback from that to improve next book
If NO (untested or poor reception):

Do NOT run ARC campaign yet
Beta read with trusted readers first
Revise if needed
THEN run ARC campaign with confidence
The Causal Truth
Beta Reading = Quality Constructor (improves product)
ARC Reviews = Visibility Constructor (improves discovery)

You need both, but sequentially: Beta → Polish → ARC → Launch

Skipping beta = gambling that product is already excellent

Sometimes justified (already tested), sometimes reckless (new manuscript).

SHOULD WE PROCEED WITH ARC REVIEW CAMPAIGN (ASSUMING BOOKS ARE QUALITY-TESTED), OR DO WE NEED BETA READING PHASE FIRST?
So, action not words, those are the key things. So I think, buying her website and basically saying to Alexandra, I could listen. The problem was that I was not on time, I missed her birthday, basically the goal is to make her write all that we have discovered, those are key factors and I have to ask her questions about if she knows him. Basically, I imagine deploying her website quickly, sending her a link, in this website she arrives, she has a letter to her, welcome to your future website as a writer, blah blah blah. Obviously, I know that it's not because you have a website, on the contrary, it's not at all, there are a lot of things that have to happen before and that's why I have to ask you a few questions about do you have x, y, z. Basically, the idea of the email is to offer her my help for the sale of her book, in my free time, no problem. And so I have to know where she is, what has been done, what has not been done. So that's where it's important to ask questions, not to arrive with answers. Obviously, we have answers to our questions, like when we ask the question, did you do the ASCP, did you do the beta reading, things like that. If she says she hasn't heard of it and she says no, it's perfect, it can tell us that this is something you absolutely have to do in order not to prioritize what has been done, what has not been done. I think she will be very happy about that. I think in my letter, in my message on the site, I am in mode, I am not very good at remembering dates and all that, but there for once I want less. Usually I don't care, but here it's my sister so it's a bit special. But in any case, I was already thinking about her since I had thought about this site and bought this domain name. Since her discussion, I have to tell her that it is since she told me that she wanted her new writer's book, that she was really starting to get tired of Akiro and that she wanted a transition. So it's serious, if it's serious, now that she has her house and that she will be able to write in an assiduous way in her house, then she needs the strategy that goes with it and the support that goes with it to develop her brand. I think you just have to write and draft a good letter, a good message, and ask questions first about what it is and then determine concrete actions. She has to understand clearly that whatever her answers are, it's me who's going to test things and take care of trying to develop her activity as a writer. On the side of distribution, marketing, getting known, all that. I think that sending her the message directly on her website is going to make a difference in my opinion. You can really introduce her and say, welcome to your website. I don't know.

Recognized heartfelt gesture; mapped strategic letter framework.




The Whole: What You're Actually Building
This isn't a website. It's a partnership proposal wrapped in a gesture of care.

The causal chain you're constructing:

Website surprise → Emotional impact → Letter explains offer → Questions diagnose state → Action plan emerges → Sister feels supported → She focuses on writing, you handle business
The core essence: You're giving her permission to be serious about her craft by taking distribution/marketing off her plate.

The Strategic Architecture
What the Website/Letter Must Accomplish:
Emotional Layer:

Acknowledge missed birthday (vulnerability builds trust)
Show you've been thinking about her (domain purchase = proof)
Demonstrate you understand her transition moment (Akiro → serious writing)
Make her feel SEEN (you noticed she's ready for the next level)
Strategic Layer:

Position yourself as distribution/marketing partner
Establish she owns creative, you own business
Create clear diagnostic framework (questions before answers)
Set expectation: You'll test/execute, she provides info
Practical Layer:

Ask questions that reveal current state
Avoid overwhelming with all CSFs at once
Make first action clear and simple
Give her easy "yes" path forward
Questions Before I Draft
On Tone:
Your sister Alexandra - what's your relationship dynamic?

Formal and respectful, or casual/playful?
Does she respond better to structured business language or emotional connection?
Would humor land, or is this a serious-only moment?
On Her Current Mindset:
You mentioned:

She's tired of "Akiro" (her day job?)
She has a new house where she can write seriously
She wants this transition
Question: Is she currently:

Burned out and needing encouragement?
Frustrated with lack of results and needing strategy?
Excited but overwhelmed and needing structure?
This changes the letter's opening emotional anchor.

On Domain/Website:
What domain did you buy? (Helps me craft "welcome to [specific URL]" language)
Is website live already, or launching when you send this?
Will it have anything beyond the letter initially? (Author bio section, book covers, or just the letter?)
On Questions to Ask Her:
You said ask questions, not prescribe. Smart. But which diagnostic areas matter most to you RIGHT NOW?

From our causal tree, the critical unknowns are:

Discovery Infrastructure:

"Have you optimized your Amazon metadata (keywords, categories)?"
"What's your current monthly page reads on KDP?"
"Do you run Amazon ads? If so, what's your monthly budget and ACOS?"
Conversion Assets:

"Do you have an email list? How many subscribers?"
"How many reviews does each book have on Amazon?"
"Do you have an ARC review team?"
Product Readiness:

"Have your books been beta-read or developmentally edited?"
"Are you happy with current cover designs?"
"What's your publishing roadmap? (Next book timeline?)"
Market Positioning:

"Who are your comp authors? (Books like [X] + [Y])"
"What makes Chronique des Premiers Hommes unique in the epic fantasy space?"
Should the letter ask ALL of these, or prioritize a few critical ones?

My recommendation: Ask 5-7 highest-leverage questions so she doesn't feel interrogated. We can do deeper diagnostic in follow-up conversation.

The Letter Structure I'm Proposing
Part 1: The Emotional Opening (2-3 paragraphs)
Acknowledge birthday miss + why this matters more
Reveal you've been planning this since her conversation about transition
Connect her new house + writing space to this being the RIGHT moment
Part 2: The Partnership Offer (2-3 paragraphs)
Clear statement: "I want to handle distribution/marketing while you write"
Explain why: You believe in her work, you have time, she should focus on craft
Set boundaries: She owns creative, you own business development
Frame as collaboration, not charity
Part 3: The Diagnostic (Bullet questions)
5-7 strategic questions to understand current state
Frame as "I need to know where you are so I can help effectively"
Make it clear: No wrong answers, just mapping the terrain
Part 4: The Next Step (1-2 paragraphs)
Simple action: "Reply to this with your answers"
Promise: "I'll create a concrete action plan based on what you tell me"
Reassurance: "I'll handle the testing and execution, you focus on writing"
Part 5: The Close (1 paragraph)
Emotional callback to partnership
Confidence in her talent
Excitement for what's ahead
The Critical Decision Points
Before I draft, you need to decide:

Decision 1: Letter Length
Short (300-400 words): Emotional + offer + 3 questions + CTA
Medium (600-800 words): Add context about why this matters, strategic vision
Long (1000+ words): Include education about the opportunity (causal factors preview)
My recommendation: Medium. Short feels transactional, long feels overwhelming.

Decision 2: Question Depth
Surface (5 yes/no questions): Quick diagnostic, follow-up needed
Deep (7-10 open questions): Comprehensive state mapping, one-shot diagnostic
My recommendation: 6-7 questions - enough to create action plan, not so many she procrastinates answering.

Decision 3: Tone Balance
70% emotional / 30% strategic: Focus on gift/support aspect
50% emotional / 50% strategic: Balanced partnership framing
30% emotional / 70% strategic: Business-focused, clear deliverables
My recommendation: 60/40 emotional/strategic. She needs to feel supported before she engages with logistics.

The Meta-Question
Why is the website delivery mechanism important to you?

Because it:

Makes it REAL (not just talk, actual infrastructure built)
Shows commitment (you invested time/money before asking anything)
Creates professional container (signals seriousness)
Feels special (birthday gift with substance)
This is psychologically brilliant. The website is proof-of-intent before the ask.

SHALL I DRAFT THE LETTER NOW WITH: MEDIUM LENGTH + 6 QUESTIONS + 60/40 EMOTIONAL/STRATEGIC TONE, OR DO YOU WANT TO ADJUST THESE PARAMETERS FIRST?
Casual and playfull, humour land. She is tired of chiropcteur and ultimatlely wat to be aa reknowned writer. . for the question i love hem all except the bpositionning maybe a bit too meta for her. 
I have not purchased it yet but will asap it alexandralisabeth.com
draft it the copy please in french


Orchestrated French copy strategy balancing humor, business diagnostics, and writer support.





# PLAN


Voici la lettre pour Alexandra
Bienvenue sur ton site d'écrivaine, Alex
Bon, déjà : joyeux anniversaire en retard. Je sais, je sais. Les dates et moi, c'est compliqué. Mais cette fois, ça me fait vraiment chier parce que c'est toi, et que justement, je pensais à toi bien avant ton anniversaire.

La preuve ? J'ai acheté ce nom de domaine.

Pas pour me faire pardonner (enfin, peut-être un peu), mais surtout parce que depuis notre discussion où tu m'as parlé de ta lassitude avec la chiro et de ton envie de vraiment passer à autre chose, de faire de l'écriture ton truc principal... ça m'a pas lâché.

Maintenant que t'as ta maison, ton espace pour écrire sérieusement, t'as plus besoin de juste "écrire sur le côté". T'as besoin d'une stratégie qui va avec. Et du support qui va avec.

Alors voilà le deal que je te propose.

Ce que je veux faire (et pourquoi)
Toi, tu écris. Moi, je m'occupe de vendre tes livres.

Pas parce que je suis charitable (quoique, t'es ma sœur). Mais parce que je crois sincèrement que tu peux devenir une écrivaine reconnue. Et que pour ça, il faut pas juste écrire des bons bouquins — il faut que les gens les trouvent.

Et ça, la distribution, le marketing, la stratégie Amazon, les communautés de lecteurs, toute cette mécanique... c'est pas ton job. C'est le mien.

Dans mon temps libre, je vais tester des trucs, optimiser ta présence, construire ton infrastructure de vente. Tu gardes le contrôle créatif total, évidemment. Mais tout ce qui est "faire en sorte que les lecteurs découvrent tes livres"? Je prends.

Mais pour pouvoir t'aider efficacement, j'ai besoin de savoir exactement où t'en es.

Les questions (réponds-moi honnêtement, y'a pas de mauvaises réponses)
Sur Amazon et la visibilité :

As-tu optimisé tes métadonnées Amazon ? (les mots-clés, les catégories, tout ce bordel technique qui fait que l'algorithme montre ton livre aux bonnes personnes)
C'est quoi tes stats mensuelles sur KDP ? (pages lues par mois, ventes, ce genre de trucs — j'ai besoin de voir la baseline)
Est-ce que tu fais de la pub Amazon ? Si oui, quel budget par mois et c'est quoi ton ACOS (coût publicitaire par vente) ?
Sur ta relation avec tes lecteurs : 4. As-tu une liste email ? Si oui, combien d'abonnés ? (C'est THE asset qui change tout, si tu l'as pas, c'est priorité numéro un)

Combien d'avis as-tu par livre sur Amazon ? (Le nombre exact pour Chronique des Premiers Hommes tome 1, 2, 3...)
As-tu une équipe ARC (des lecteurs qui reçoivent ton livre en avance et laissent des avis au lancement) ?
Sur la qualité et le produit : 7. Tes livres ont été beta-lus ou édités professionnellement ? (Je veux savoir si le produit est solide ou s'il y a des ajustements à faire)

Es-tu satisfaite de tes couvertures actuelles ? (Parce que ça compte BEAUCOUP pour les clics)
Sur la suite : 9. C'est quoi ton plan d'écriture ? (Prochain livre prévu quand ? Tu veux sortir combien de livres dans les 12-24 prochains mois ?)

Ce qui se passe ensuite
Tu me réponds à ces questions (tranquille, prends ton temps, mais réponds quand même).

À partir de tes réponses, je te monte un plan d'action concret. Pas des idées vagues, des trucs actionnables avec un ordre de priorité.

Et ensuite, je teste et j'exécute. Toi, tu te concentres sur écrire la suite de la saga et devenir encore meilleure dans ton craft. Moi, je fais en sorte que le monde découvre ce que tu crées.

Pour finir
T'as le talent. T'as les livres. T'as maintenant la maison et l'espace pour écrire sérieusement.

Ce qui te manque, c'est juste quelqu'un qui s'occupe de la partie business pendant que tu fais ce que tu fais de mieux.

Alors voilà, c'est moi. Et ce site, c'est le début.

Bienvenue sur alexandralisabeth.com — ton futur QG d'écrivaine reconnue.

Maintenant, réponds-moi à ces questions et on y va. 🚀

— Ton frère qui oublie les dates mais pas les projets importants
